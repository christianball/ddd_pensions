# DDD Pensions

This is my coursework for module 3 of the [Rails Architect MasterClass](https://railsarchitects.com/)

It demonstrates the following features:

1. Event sourcing achieved with the gem [Rails Event Store](https://railseventstore.org/)
2. A basic use of the CQRS architectural pattern
3. Implementation of DDD concepts: "bounded context", "read model", "aggregate", "entity" and "value object"

Usage:

    $ git clone https://github.com/christianball/ddd_pensions.git
    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec rspec
